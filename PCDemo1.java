/*
------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS IN THIS UNSYNCHRONIZED VERSION:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Producer keeps producing even when buffer is full.
   -> Just prints a message instead of waiting.

2. Consumer keeps consuming even when buffer is empty.
   -> Just prints a message instead of waiting.

3. Race Condition:
   - Producer and Consumer run in parallel without synchronization.
   - This may lead to out-of-order outputs (e.g., Consumer consumes
     an item before Producer's "Produced" message is printed).

This version demonstrates WHY synchronization (synchronized,
wait, notify) is needed in the Producerâ€“Consumer problem.
